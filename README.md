## **Project Description**  
Given a boolean expression, Truth Table Generator will generate the truth table with all possible combinations of unique variables! Leveraging both binary tree and stack data structures with complex algorithms! 

## **How to Use**
1. Clone this repository using the link
2. Change directory (CD) to this repository
3. Type in 'make' to compile the project
4. Type in './main' to run the code
5. Try out new combinations!

## **Incremental Delivery (current product...)**  

#### **Sama**  
- Implemented building of binary tree implementation in C
- Implemented additional parsing of input String to ensure valid boolean expression (See parsing.c)
- Developed printTree method for simple debugging
- Extended the code to allow GUI using the GTK library in C
- Extended the code to do extra functionality such as negating an expression

#### **Tasnim**  
- Integration of building of binary tree with the evaluation component
- Implemented formatted output of the evaluated boolean expression
- Integrated evaluation of negation (unary) operator

#### **Luna**  
- Developed logic for evaluated boolean expression given the built binary tree
- Developed workflows and test cases, implementing Gcov coverage results 
- Organized project into various .c and .h files to group functions with similar attributes

#### **Kristian**  
- Developed building of binary tree implementation in Python
- Configured repo with file organization to ensure modularity
- Developed proprocessing functions to reduce strictness of input (See parsing branch)
